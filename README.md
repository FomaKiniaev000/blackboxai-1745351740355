# Budget-OS

Budget-OS is a web-based cloud PC platform designed to provide users with an accessible and powerful computing environment from anywhere in the world. It allows users and administrators to log in to a customizable desktop experience complete with file management, console access, and user management features.

## Project Overview

This project consists of multiple HTML pages that simulate a desktop experience. Users can log in, manage files, access a console, and for administrators, manage users directly from the web interface. The platform uses modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.
